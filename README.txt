I wanted to make a dungeon, where the user would be able to run through the dungeon and play games at each floor to eventually make it to the end.
You would have to win a game to move onto the next one. The computer the player is playing against would be a master of the game and it would be challenging to defeat them.
Once you defeat all of the masters, you make it to the end and you win. I didn't end up making the full story, but I did end up making the games.
I created a main menu that the user can use to play each game. Once each game is done, it takes you back to the main menu and you can then choose to play another game.

Creating the project was a bit difficult. Creating games just using python is hard because it has to be text based. I thought about making a game that shows up in another window, but
I didn't know how to fully implement it or use it in the code. I eventually found out I could make rock paper scissors and that's where I started.
Reaching the first milestone wasn't that hard since all we had to do was make a function. I made the rock paper scissors game and it required a lot of if statements.
It wasn't hard to make, but it required a lot of repetition. For the second milestone I needed to create something that had an output. I already had this with the rock paper scissors
game, but there was no way to run other games along side it. There was also no way for the player to pick the game they were playing. I then had to make a main menu so
the user could move through games easily. The main menu was difficult make, because I didn't know where to start. My professor helped me get it started, and then it
just worked for every other game that I implemented. I also added a higher lower game, where the user has to guess if the number chosen is above, below or equal to 50.
This game was very similar to the rock paper scissors game and was easy to add in. For the final part of the project I added a hangman game. This game was very difficult to make.
I didn't know how to make the game read each letter and fill the word in. I also didn't know how to eliminate letters after they were already guessed. I had to look
over different peoples projects and make sense of what they were doing to create my own. It turned out well though and does exactly what I wanted it to do. If I were to do the project
again, I would have focused more on trying to do my original idea. I didn't really focus on making the story of the game or making it a linear experience, where the player has to
complete one task in order to get to the next one. I focused and put a lot of time in trying to get the games to work right and I forgot about trying to make a story along with it.

Some corrections I got was to make the program more robust. My first milestone was just a game and it wasn't even inside of a function. I had to put it into a function and then
make it able to be called from the main menu. Once I put it in the function I made the main menu call the function when the user typed in the number 1. I also put the main menu
function after each if statement so that after the game was over it would go back to the main menu. I was also told to make my code stronger, because it didn't filter out any wrong
words. If someone put in the incorrect word then the program just wouldn't do anything. I then added to my if statements an option that would ask the user to input again if the word
didn't work. The games would also end after each play through and I needed a way to allow the user to continuously play games. I added the main menu function into the if statements as well
and it put the player back into the main menu to pick another game.
